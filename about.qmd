This site visualizes and disseminates data from [Roy, Frank, Decamp, Miller, & Roy (2015), PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1419773112).

The website is based on a Shiny app originally made for the publication by [Mike Frank](http://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank). This demo showcases the use of Observable for client-side visualizations.
